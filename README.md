# Blog-Site

Created this blog site prototype using ejs in order to learn how to incorporate javascript into an html file. Used NodeJS and ExpressJS as a backend server. Utilized the routing available in ExpressJS, as well as the body-parser module.

Create a new blog post that is displayed on the home page by using the route /compose.
